## Set up

Before you start working on the assignment, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps
to get started:

1. **GitHub Account:** If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [www.github.com](https://www.github.com)
   and create one. Please use your real name as your GitHub username, all in lowercase with no spaces (e.g., `samirm00`).

2. **Create a New Repository:** Click on "Use this template" in the repository where you found this README and
   create a new repository on your GitHub account.

3. **Install Git:** Ensure that you have Git installed on your computer. You can install Git depending on your
   operating system. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

4. **Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code, a text editor that will help you write your code.
   You can download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

5. **Live Server Extension:** Install the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code. Once installed,
   right-click on your `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" to preview your calculator in
   your browser. Please use Google Chrome for the best experience.

6. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the assignment repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/new-applicants-assignment.git
   ```

   Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username.

7. **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, please install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

8. **Open Terminal in VS Code:** Open Visual Studio Code and click on "Terminal," then choose "New Terminal."

9. **Install Dependencies:** Install the project dependencies by running the following command inside your project folder:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

10. **Start Writing Your Code:** Now you are ready to start adding your code for the calculator.

## Development Process

Follow these steps to develop your calculator project:

### 1. Cloning the Repository

You've already cloned the repository to your local machine in the setup phase. This repository contains
the starter files and this README.

### 2. Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have installed Node.js, and then install the project dependencies by running the following
command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Writing Your Code

This is where you will implement your calculator. Open the project in Visual Studio Code and start
writing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the provided files.

### 4. Code Formatting

To ensure consistent code formatting, use the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

### 5. Spell Check

Check your code for spelling errors using:

```bash
npm run spell-check
```

### 6. Linting

Lint your code for best practices:

```bash
npm run lint:ls
```

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

### 7. Committing Your Changes

Once you have completed your calculator project, follow these steps to commit your changes to GitHub:

1. Add your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add calculator project'
   ```

3. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Assignment Details

Your task is to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure is already
provided in the starter files. You will need to write the CSS to style the calculator and the JavaScript
to make it functional.

## Submission

Once you have completed your calculator project and pushed your changes to your GitHub repository,
you are ready to submit your assignment. Please provide a link to your GitHub repository in the
submission form provided by HackYourFuture.

Good luck with your assignment, and welcome to HackYourFuture! If you have any questions or need
assistance, feel free to reach out to the community or instructors. Happy coding!
